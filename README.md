This is my final project from AB-Tech WEB289 class. The project is a website that uses categories and products to demonstrate different techniques in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery and MySQL.

The website allows a user to view the general information about the company and products it offers for sale. If a user decides to register they will be able to receive a discount on their purchases, search products and create comments. The admin can create and delete category names with prices and discounts. Admin can create and delete new products for each category. They can view and delete all comments from every user.

The website has a page for employment. Individuals are encouraged to call, text or email the owner about existing employment opportunities.
